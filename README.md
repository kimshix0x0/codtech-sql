# codtech-sql: Task 1
--> CodTech SQL Analytics Project
This project showcases SQL queries and relational database analysis for CodTech, an e-commerce business. Using customer and account data, we apply key SQL operations to understand relationships, retrieve insights, and prepare the foundation for deeper business analysis.
-->🎯 Project Objective
To perform SQL-based data exploration on CodTech’s customer and account data using various types of joins and set operations. This project demonstrates how relational databases can be queried to uncover meaningful connections between business entities.

--> 📁 Dataset Overview
The project uses two main tables:
> customer: Contains customer details.
> account: Contains account and transaction-related data.

-->📊 Key SQL Concepts Used
> INNER JOIN: To get customers with matching account records.
> LEFT JOIN: To retain all accounts, even without customer data.
> RIGHT JOIN: To show customers with or without matching accounts.
> UNION: To combine LEFT and RIGHT JOIN results to mimic a FULL OUTER JOIN.
